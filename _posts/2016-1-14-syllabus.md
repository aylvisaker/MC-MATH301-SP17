# FIX EVERYTHING BELOW THIS POINT
# Course Schedule / Content
A detailed schedule can be found on the course webpage. This will be kept up to date as the semester progresses. We have a total of 55 class days scheduled (not including labs). Of those, 9 have been allotted for exams. We will require at least 36 days for class discussions. This leaves 14 flex days (a little bit less than one per week). Flex days can be used at any time for any reason as long as it is approved by a simple majority of students who are present. You may want to use one for a review day before an exam, or to spend some extra time discussing a particularly difficult section in the book.

* Chapter 5 : Integrals
* Chapter 6 : Applications of Integration

# Grading Scale
Your overall grade for the course will be computed as the average of your exam scores and follow the standard 90/80/70/60 scale, with 90 sufficient for some kind of A, 80 sufficient for some kind of B, etc. Plus and minus grades will be assigned at the instructor's discretion, typically the lower third of the range (0-3) earning a minus and the upper third of the range (7 and up) earning a plus.

# Exams
Exams must be written in pencil. Any exam written in pen will have 10% deducted from the final score.

Some students assume it is okay to listen to music while they take an exam. In this class that is not okay. If you are caught wearing headphones, your exam will be taken from you and you will receive a zero. If you need to use the restroom during an exam, leave all of your things behind (especially your phone) and quietly excuse yourself (eye contact with me is good enough, no need to make a production of it).

Scheduled exam dates are available on the course calendar. These will likely change as we burn flex days, but will otherwise proceed on schedule. I will make an effort to remind you when an exam is coming up, but it is ultimately your responsibility to pay attention to the calendar.

The final exam will be cumulative and takes place on either Saturday, May 6 at 3:00 PM or Friday, May 5 at 11:30 AM. This is not to imply that it is your choice to make, rather that registrar's schedule is ambiguous. I will make an announcement in class and update this document when I have clarification. The exam will take place in CSB 323. This exam cannot be rescheduled except under extreme circumstances.

# Workload Expectations
In addition to attending class each day, students should plan to spend approximately 10 hours per week working outside of class. This time should be spent reading, completing homework, studying, and making use of available resources. The figure is only an estimated average, some students may need to spend much more than 10 hours practicing in order to learn the material effectively.

# Classroom Expectations

Each day students should plan to bring 
* a graphing calculator (recommended model is the TI-84)
* the textbook
* pencil and paper
* questions from the reading
* problems from the homework

Social media use (whether on a phone or a computer) is not allowed in this class. It is distracting at best, disruptive at worst, and downright rude in every instance. Phones should be silenced before class begins and kept put away while class is in session. If you must have your phone on due to an imminent emergency, it should be kept on vibrate and you should quietly leave the room to answer any calls or texts. If you are caught using a your phone in class, you will be asked to leave. Please don't make this an issue.

The seating arrangement will be left to your discretion so long as it doesn't create problems. If we start having problems staying on task, I will shuffle students around. That will probably mean displacing another student from his/her chosen seat, so please don't make this necessary.

# Academic Dishonesty
In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an F or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the students course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of F and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of any violations.

# Disability Accommodations
Accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis by considering the disability documentation provided by the student, the functional impact of the students disability, and the essential requirements of the students courses, programs, and activities. Disability Services works in conjunction with faculty to determine appropriate accommodations for students in their courses. Please contact Disability Services at the Teaching and Learning Center, 2nd floor Poling Hall, 309-457-2257, or tlc@monmouthcollege.edu with specific disability or accommodation related questions.
